# AFS
An AI File Server Project

## Why

We have a lot of data, stored somewhere. But the way we store them is not structual. 

Sometimes, I want to know what it is in just 1 Tera-bytes folder. So this is why I start this project.

## Goal

1. Image & Video.
2. Text.
3. 

### Information

1. Content
2. Metadata (i.e. time,size, etc.)

4. 

## Techs

## Plan
